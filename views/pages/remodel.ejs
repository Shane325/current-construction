                                        <h4>What are the benefits of a remodel?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            A high-end remodel, particularly in San Francisco, will increase the value of your
                                            property and can be a lucrative investment.
                                            Especially during a property and construction
                                            boom. This rings true for your personal
                                            residence, a rental property that you
                                            own or a new property that you purchase.
                                            We believe a high-end remodel is worth
                                            the investment for this reason alone.
                                            Finances aside, remodeling your San
                                            Francisco property has many other benefits
                                            including reduced maintenance and utility
                                            costs, lifestyle improvements, increased
                                            and more efficient livable space and
                                            updating your property to match your
                                            lifestyle without having to move. Minor
                                            additions to your property can also
                                            greatly increase your standard of living.
                                            Consider additional outdoor living
                                            space like a deck or patio, or perhaps
                                            an ADU (Additional Dwelling Unit) which
                                            can be used as a rental unit. We’ve
                                            love to hear about your remodel plans.

                                            High-end remodel costs in San Francisco can vary greatly depending on the scope
                                            of work, list of materials and the
                                            property size / footprint. In our experience,
                                            the cost per build typically falls
                                            between $250/sq. ft and $450/sq. ft

                                        <h4>What steps are involved in a remodel?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            When you embark on a remodel in San Francisco the process generally looks like
                                            this:

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    The first step is to create plans for your remodel. We recommend hiring a reputable
                                                    architect to draw up the plans.
                                                    We regularly work with architects
                                                    in San Francisco and we are
                                                    happy to recommend one.

                                                </li>
                                                <br>
                                                <li>
                                                    Your properties plans must then be submitted to, and approved by the City of San
                                                    Francisco. This can be a difficult
                                                    and tedious process that may
                                                    involve some back and forth
                                                    with the City. Hiring a competent
                                                    and professional architect
                                                    will greatly improve the efficiency
                                                    of getting your plans approved.

                                                </li>
                                                <br>
                                                <li>

                                                    Once your building plans have been approved by the City you are free to start construction.
                                                    It is at this stage that you
                                                    hire a contractor to carry
                                                    out the work specified in the
                                                    plans. We encourage you to

                                            <strong>Use a licensed contractor.</strong>                                            It is illegal to contract with an unlicensed
                                            contractor in California when the construction
                                            work is valued at more than $500 combined
                                            labor and materials. The law provides
                                            several protections for homeowners
                                            when they deal with a licensed contractor.
                                            A licensed contractor is required to
                                            carry a $10,000 bond. Additionally,
                                            the State License Board carefully monitors
                                            the activity and ethics of the licensed
                                            contractors.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Use a bonded contractor.</strong>                                            A Contractor’s Bond protects the customer.
                                            Should your contractor cause damage,
                                            not fulfill their end of the agreement,
                                            be paid in excess for the amount of
                                            work completed, or take a deposit and
                                            then disappear, a Contractor’s Bond
                                            will pay out up to $10,000. The bonding
                                            company will then use their resources
                                            to recoup this money from the contractor.
                                            The Bond also protects against theft
                                            by the contractor.

                                            <strong>Make sure the contractor you hire carries Workers Compensation Insurance.</strong>                                            As you can imagine, construction is
                                            a high-risk profession where workers
                                            are injured more frequently relative
                                            to other lines of work. And of course
                                            the cost of medical care is ever increasing.
                                            Should your contractor not carry workers
                                            compensation insurance, it becomes
                                            your liability to cover the medical
                                            expenses for injured workers on your
                                            property. While a contractor with employees
                                            is required to carry insurance, many
                                            don’t.

                                            <strong>Get everything in writing.</strong>                                            Current Construction does not work
                                            with verbal agreements. When you want
                                            something to happen we will put it
                                            in writing. This policy protects both
                                            property owner and our company. Documented
                                            confirmation is a great communication
                                            device when the scope-of-work or materials
                                            are amended in writing, as such adjustments
                                            generally involve a change in price.

                                            <strong>Establish a warranty period.</strong>                                            California law requires licensed contractors
                                            to provide a one-year guarantee of
                                            their work. Sadly, many contractors
                                            never revisit their completed jobs
                                            because their livelihood is focused
                                            on their current jobs. Current Construction
                                            proactively performs a follow up visit
                                            within 30-days after completion and
                                            then remains ready to respond to problems
                                            or issues that arise at any time during
                                            the warranty period.

                                            <strong>Establish a progress based payment schedule.</strong>                                            Contractors often schedule payments
                                            for a certain time frame, perhaps every
                                            Friday, regardless of progress. Some
                                            even set payments in a way to get money
                                            before a substantial amount of work
                                            is completed. Current Constructions
                                            chooses to schedule payments based
                                            upon certain completion points, and
                                            when able, upon passing inspections.

                                        <h4>What is a Soft Story building?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            A soft story building is a multi floor building in which one or more floors are
                                            “soft” due to the structural design
                                            of the property. A typical soft story
                                            building has three or more stories
                                            and the ground level has large openings,
                                            like large windows or a parking garage.
                                            Buildings are classified as having
                                            a “soft story” if one level is less
                                            than 70% as stiff as the level immediately
                                            above it OR less than 80% as stiff
                                            as the average stiffness of the three
                                            floors above it.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            The design of soft story buildings makes them particularly vulnerable to collapse
                                            during an earthquake. In fact, soft
                                            story failure was responsible for nearly
                                            half of all homes that became uninhabitable
                                            in Northern California’s 1989 earthquake.
                                            In the event of a more significant
                                            earthquake in the Bay Area, experts
                                            predict that soft story buildings may
                                            cause severe damage and possible destruction
                                            of 160,000 homes.

                                            Because of these risks, the City of San Francisco introduced the Soft Story Retrofit
                                            Program in 2013.

                                            Program?

                                            The Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program (MSSP) was created by the City of San
                                            Francisco with the purpose of ensuring
                                            the safety and resilience of the cities
                                            properties by retrofitting older, wooden
                                            frame, multi-family buildings that
                                            have a soft story condition.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Who does the program effect?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            The program effects property owners of soft story buildings in San Francisco. Soft
                                            story buildings must be seismically
                                            strengthened to comply with the city
                                            ordinance. All effected property owners
                                            were notified in September 2013 and
                                            were required to submit screening forms
                                            to the Department of Building Inspections
                                            by September 2014. More specifically,
                                            the ordinance applies to wood-frame
                                            buildings with three of more stories
                                            or two stories over a basement or underfloor
                                            area that have any portion extending
                                            above grade, and containing five or
                                            more residential units where the construction
                                            permit was applied for before January
                                            1978, and where the building has not
                                            yet been seismically upgraded. The
                                            final deadline for completion of work
                                            is September 2020.

                                            The construction timeframe of a Soft Story retrofit can vary depending on the building
                                            size and footprint. Current Construction
                                            are highly experienced with soft story
                                            retrofits in San Francisco and our
                                            retrofits generally take between 6
                                            to 10 weeks. Please contact us for
                                            a more accurate time estimate.

                                        <h4>How much does a Soft Story Retrofit cost?

                                        <p>
                                            A soft story retrofit is relatively cost effective when compared to the overall
                                            property value. Like the timeframe,
                                            the cost of a retrofit also varies
                                            depending on building size and footprint.
                                            In our experience, the typical cost
                                            falls between the $60,000 to $150,000
                                            price range. Again, please contact
                                            us for a more accurate cost estimate.

                                            retrofit.
